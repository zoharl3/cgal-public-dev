\section HoleFillingIntroduction Introduction

This package provides set of algorithms for filling a hole that is either in a triangulated surface mesh or defined by sequence of points. 
The main steps of the algorithm are described in \cgalCite{Lepia2003FillingHoles} and can be summarized as follows.
First, a triangular patch for the hole is generated without introducing any new vertex. 
Second, generated patch is refined by creating new vertices and flipping edges to approximate density of near boundary triangles.
Third, refined region is faired to provide tangential continuous and smooth patch.
