\section howto How to use BGL named parameters

The sequence should start with `CGAL::parameters::`

\section list List of available named parameters

Given a `PolygonMesh` type of BGL graph,
and a `Kernel` in which constructions are performed and predicates evaluated.

<ul>
<li> `vertex_point_map`. An instance of a class model of `ReadablePropertyMap` with
`boost::graph_traits<PolygonMesh>::%vertex_descriptor` as key type and
`Kernel::Point_3` as value type.

<li> `use_delaunay_triangulation`. A boolean. If `true`, use the Delaunay triangulation facet search space. Its default value is `true`.

<li> `density_control_factor`. A floating scalar value which controls the density of the mesh generated by refinement. Its default value is `CGAL::sqrt(2)`.

<li> `fairing_continuity`. An unsigned integer which controls the tangential continuity of the output surface for fairing. The possible values are 0, 1 and 2, refering to the C^0, C^1 and C^2 continuity. The default value is 1.

<li> `sparse_linear_solver`. An instance of the sparse linear solver used for fairing. It defaults to the Eigen solver ***

</ul>
